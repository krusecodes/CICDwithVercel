# social-graph
Implement the social graph feature using open source technology. 

### Scope
Solution should be a prototype and use dummy data that mirrors an API similar to api.opensauced.pizza

Length: 4-7hrs

A private repo will be created for the candidate to work out of and communicate with OpenSauced team members.

### Bonus

- Prototype is reusable and shareable.
- Smooth and performant animations.
- Consumes live API (prototyped).
- Document the process like [this](https://twitter.com/foxy_blocks/status/1691892199750001111).
- Design doc is preferred. Working prototype is ideal if time allows.

### Next Steps
1. Open an issue in this repo with an approach or design doc.
2. Attempt to implement a prototype on a new branch as a pull request.
